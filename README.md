Project: Visual Studio 2015


This game is an extended version of Urho-Physics hololens template.
Added features:
1. Basketball-textured ball.
2. 2D text game properties and information.
3. Scoring mechanism.
4. Throwing gauge mechanic.

Initialisation: place the bucket to a flat surface indicated by the green color of the bucket.
Then, the bucket ball game will start by a single air tap.

Throwing ball is done in two-step air taps (do not confuse with double air taps):<br>
a) First air tap shows the throwing gauge that linearly changes from 0 to 15. Throwing gauge changes ascending and descending until the second air tap is proceed.<br>
b) Second air tap sets the throwing gauge and throws the ball accordingly.<br>
c) Any ball getting into the bucket adds +1 score.
