This game is an extended version of Urho-Physics hololens template.
Added features:
1. Basketball-textured ball.
2. 2D text game properties and information.
3. Scoring mechanism.
4. Throwing gauge mechanic.

Initialisation: place the bucket to a flat surface indicated by the green color of the bucket.
Then, the bucket ball game will start by a single air tap.

Throwing ball is done in two-step air taps (do not confuse with double air taps):
a) First air tap shows the throwing gauge that linearly changes from 0 to 15. Throwing gauge changes ascending and descending until the second air tap is proceed.
b) Second air tap sets the throwing gauge and throws the ball accordingly.
c) Any ball getting into the bucket adds +1 score.
